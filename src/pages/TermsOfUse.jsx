            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">1.1 Intermediary Platform</h3>
            <p>TagAlong operates a digital platform where creators and curators of travel content (“Creators”) can share recommendations for destinations, experiences, tours, accommodations, and related services (collectively, “Travel Offerings”), and where users may discover and navigate to third‑party booking sites. TagAlong is not a travel agency, seller of travel, tour operator, lodging provider, transportation provider, insurer, or merchant of record.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">1.2 Affiliate Monetization</h3>
            <p>TagAlong’s revenue model primarily involves participation in third‑party affiliate and referral programs (e.g., programs operated by companies such as Viator.com, Booking.com, and Expedia.com). References to such companies are for identification only and do not imply sponsorship, affiliation, partnership, endorsement, or joint venture. TagAlong is an independent intermediary and is not a party to any transaction you enter with a third‑party travel supplier, marketplace, or affiliate network.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">1.3 No Control Over Travel Suppliers</h3>
            <p>Travel Offerings linked through the Services are owned, operated, and fulfilled by independent third parties (“Travel Suppliers”), and are subject to their terms, conditions, policies, availability, and pricing. TagAlong does not set prices, control inventory, make or modify reservations, collect or remit taxes or fees on behalf of any Travel Supplier, provide customer service for booked Travel Offerings, or assume responsibility for Travel Suppliers’ acts, omissions, services, or policies.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">1.4 No Professional Advice</h3>
            <p>Content presented on the Services is provided for informational and discovery purposes only and does not constitute travel, legal, insurance, health, or safety advice. You are solely responsible for verifying all Travel Offerings, restrictions, and requirements (e.g., passports, visas, health advisories, local laws, weather, safety, and travel insurance).</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">2. Eligibility; Accounts; Identity Verification</h2>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">2.1 Eligibility</h3>
            <p>The Services are not intended for children under 13. If you are at least 13 but under 18 (or the age of majority where you live), you may use the Services only with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">2.2 Creator Accounts</h3>
            <p>To become a Creator, you must apply for an account and provide accurate, current, and complete information. Approval, suspension, or termination of any account is in TagAlong’s sole discretion. You agree to keep your account information current and to maintain the confidentiality of your credentials. If you register on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and references to “you” include that entity.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">2.3 Identity and Compliance Checks</h3>
            <p>We may require identity verification, tax documentation, and other information (e.g., government‑issued ID, proof of address, or social account ownership) to validate eligibility, comply with law, mitigate fraud, or administer payouts. You authorize us to make inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and eligibility.</p>
            
            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">3. Acceptance of Terms; Updates; Electronic Communications</h2>

            <p>You consent to receive notices, disclosures, and other communications electronically, including to any email address you provide or via in‑Service notifications.</p>

            <p>You agree not to, and not to enable others to: (a) access, scrape, harvest, or index the Services or data therefrom (including via bots, spiders, crawlers) except through documented public interfaces; (b) circumvent or interfere with security or access controls; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Services; (d) misuse tracking, attribution, or payout tools; (e) register or use confusingly similar domain names, trademarks, or social handles; (f) upload or transmit malware, spam, or unauthorized advertising; (g) use the Services to build or operate a competing or substitute affiliate network, sub‑affiliate scheme, or white‑label offering; (h) misrepresent Travel Offerings or your relationship with TagAlong or any Travel Supplier; (i) engage in fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative behavior; or (j) otherwise violate law or these Terms.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">4.3 Inappropriate Content</h3>
            <p>We may remove content and/or suspend accounts for content that is illegal, infringing, deceptive, harassing, hateful, discriminatory, obscene, sexually explicit, violent, privacy‑invasive, unsafe, or otherwise objectionable in our sole discretion, including content directed at children under 13 or violating consumer‑protection, disclosure, or advertising laws.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">4.4 Content Moderation</h3>
            <p>We may revise, remove, or restrict access to any content for any reason, at any time, with or without notice.</p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">5.1 FTC Disclosures</h3>
            <p>Creators must comply with all applicable laws and regulatory guidance relating to endorsements, testimonials, and disclosures of material connections (including, without limitation, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, “.com Disclosures,” and related guidance). Disclosures must be clear and conspicuous in the same medium as the content (visual, audible, audiovisual) and appear proximate to the recommendation (e.g., “#ad,” “#sponsored,” or “commissionable link”).</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">5.2 Other Jurisdictions</h3>
            <p>If you operate outside the U.S., you must comply with local consumer‑protection, advertising, and disclosure laws (e.g., ASA/CAP in the UK; EU Unfair Commercial Practices; Canadian standards). You are solely responsible for your compliance.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">5.3 Truthful, Non‑Misleading Content</h3>
            <p>Your statements must reflect your honest opinions, findings, and experiences with any Travel Offering. Do not make unsubstantiated claims (e.g., “best price guaranteed”) or represent that TagAlong endorses, sponsors, or is partnered with any Travel Supplier unless we have expressly stated so.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">6. Intellectual Property; License to TagAlong</h2>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">6.1 Your Content</h3>
            <p>You represent and warrant you own or have all necessary rights to any content you submit, post, or display on or through the Services (“User Content”) and that such content does not infringe or violate any third‑party rights.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">6.2 License to TagAlong</h3>
            <p>You grant TagAlong a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free, sublicensable, transferable license to host, store, reproduce, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and otherwise use your User Content in connection with operating, improving, marketing, and providing the Services.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">6.3 Reservation of Rights</h3>
            <p>Except for the rights expressly granted to us in these Terms, you retain ownership of your User Content. TagAlong and its licensors retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services and TagAlong IP.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">6.4 DMCA</h3>
            <p>If you believe content on the Services infringes your copyright, please send a notice of claimed infringement to: RoosterGoose, LLC (d/b/a TagAlong.me), Attn: DMCA Agent, 1560 E Southlake Blvd, Southlake, TX 76092, USA, or by calling +1 (888) 712‑2895. Your notice must comply with 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3). We may remove or disable access to allegedly infringing material and may terminate repeat infringers’ accounts.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">7. Third‑Party Sites; No Endorsement</h2>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">7.1 Links and Integrations</h3>
            <p>The Services may link to or integrate with third‑party websites, apps, affiliate networks, analytics providers, and Travel Suppliers. TagAlong is not responsible for third‑party content, terms, policies, or practices and does not endorse any third‑party offerings.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">7.2 Transactions With Third Parties</h3>
            <p>Any transactions you make with Travel Suppliers are solely between you and the applicable third party. TagAlong is not a party to such transactions and disclaims all responsibility arising therefrom.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">8. Tracking, Attribution, and Commission Eligibility (Creators)</h2>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.1 How Tracking Works</h3>
            <p>Creators may include affiliate or referral links, codes, deep links, pixels, or other identifiers (“Tracking Tools”) in their content. Eligibility for commission is determined by the relevant affiliate program’s tracking and attribution rules (e.g., last‑click attribution, cookie windows, device‑level or session‑level tracking, program‑specific exclusions).</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.2 No Guarantee of Tracking</h3>
            <p>Tracking can fail or be interrupted for many reasons beyond TagAlong’s control, including but not limited to user privacy settings, cookie blocking, ad blockers, ITP/ETP, VPNs, cross‑device behavior, in‑app browsers, deep‑link failures, latency, competing referrals, overwritten cookies, or changes made by affiliate networks, Travel Suppliers, or platforms. TagAlong does not guarantee that any click, view, or impression will be tracked or attributed to you.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.3 Commission Contingencies; No Cover for Non‑Payment</h3>
            <p>Commissions are contingent on (a) the applicable affiliate network’s or Travel Supplier’s final approval of a transaction, (b) their payment to TagAlong, and (c) your full compliance with these Terms and program rules. If an affiliate or Travel Supplier does not track, approve, or pay a commission for any reason, or if a link dies, breaks, or is otherwise untrackable, you understand and agree that no commission is due and any expected commission is forfeited. TagAlong will not advance, front, or cover any unpaid or reversed commissions.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.4 Reversals and Adjustments</h3>
            <p>Commissions may be denied, reversed, or adjusted due to, for example, cancellations, returns, chargebacks, fraud, policy violations, program exclusions, duplicate or conflicting attributions, use of non‑commissionable codes, or pricing errors. TagAlong may deduct or offset any reversals or adjustments from future payouts or require repayment.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.5 Payout Timing</h3>
            <p>Subject to the foregoing, TagAlong will remit earned commissions to you within 30 days after TagAlong actually receives the corresponding payment from the applicable affiliate network or Travel Supplier and after any required hold periods or reconciliation are complete. Timing may vary by program and provider.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.6 Payment Methods; Minimums</h3>
            <p>We may set minimum payout thresholds, supported currencies, fees, and payment methods (e.g., ACH, wire, third‑party processors). You are responsible for providing accurate payout details. We are not responsible for delayed or failed payments caused by inaccurate information you provide.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.7 Taxes; Forms</h3>
            <p>You are responsible for all taxes arising from commissions. You agree to provide tax forms (e.g., IRS Form W‑9/W‑8) and any other information we require. We may withhold payments as required by law.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.8 Fraud, Abuse, and Audit</h3>
            <p>We may investigate suspected fraud or abuse and withhold, freeze, or reverse payouts pending investigation. You agree to cooperate and provide reasonable records. We may maintain reserves if we reasonably believe reversals or chargebacks are likely.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">8.9 No Sub‑Affiliate Networks</h3>
            <p>You may not use the Services to build or operate a sub‑affiliate network, to extend access to TagAlong tracking or payouts to third parties, or to pay, subsidize, or otherwise compensate others based on TagAlong’s tracking or commission structure.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">9. Community Guidelines; User Conduct</h2>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">9.1 Civility</h3>
            <p>We are committed to a respectful environment. We may remove users or content for harassment, hate speech, or offensive conduct.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">9.2 Safety and Risk</h3>
            <p>Travel involves inherent risks. You acknowledge that you may be exposed to risks including illness, injury, property damage, crime, terrorism, extreme weather, or natural disasters. You are solely responsible for evaluating your risk tolerance and obtaining appropriate insurance (e.g., travel, health, evacuation, cancellation).</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">10. Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share personal information. By using the Services, you consent to our data practices as described there. Where required, you will obtain all necessary consents for the collection and sharing of personal data reflected in your use of Tracking Tools.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">11. Termination and Suspension</h2>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">11.1 By Us</h3>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services (including payouts) at any time, with or without notice, for any reason or no reason, including violation of these Terms or suspected fraud or abuse.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">11.2 Effect of Termination</h3>
            <p>Upon termination, your license to use the Services ends and you must cease use. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive (including, without limitation, Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 12–18).</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">12. Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TAGALONG DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TAGALONG DOES NOT WARRANT THAT (A) THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR‑FREE; (B) TRACKING OR ATTRIBUTION WILL OCCUR OR BE ACCURATE; (C) ANY CONTENT IS CURRENT, COMPLETE, OR RELIABLE; OR (D) TRAVEL OFFERINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE, SAFE, OR MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TAGALONG WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA; FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION; OR FOR COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL TAGALONG’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO TAGALONG (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE OR (B) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$100).</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages; in such cases, TagAlong’s liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">14. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TagAlong, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (a) your use or misuse of the Services; (b) your User Content; (c) your violation of these Terms or any law; (d) your interactions or transactions with Travel Suppliers; or (e) your failure to make required disclosures or other compliance obligations.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">15. Sanctions and Export Controls</h2>
            <p>You represent and warrant that you are not subject to sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations, the EU, or the UK, and that you will not use the Services in violation of applicable export control or sanctions laws.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">16. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Class Action Waiver</h2>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">16.1 Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">16.2 Arbitration</h3>
            <p>Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services (“Dispute”) shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in English by a single arbitrator seated in Dallas County, Texas. The arbitrator may award any relief available under applicable law and shall issue a reasoned written award. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">16.3 Individual Basis Only</h3>
            <p>YOU AND TAGALONG AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS OF MULTIPLE PARTIES. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THIS SECTION 16 (ARBITRATION) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID AND DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">16.4 Injunctive Relief</h3>
            <p>Nothing in this Section limits either party’s right to seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its rights pending arbitration.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">17. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>TagAlong shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil disturbances, labor disputes, epidemics, governmental actions, utility or internet outages, or failures of suppliers or service providers.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">18. Miscellaneous</h2>

            <p>These Terms, together with any policies referenced herein (including the Privacy Policy), constitute the entire agreement between you and TagAlong regarding the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">18.2 Severability</h3>
            <p>If any provision is found unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">18.3 No Waiver</h3>
            <p>Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of future enforcement.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">18.4 Assignment</h3>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations hereunder without TagAlong’s prior written consent. TagAlong may assign these Terms without notice.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">18.5 Independent Contractors</h3>
            <p>The parties are independent contractors; nothing herein creates a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship.</p>
            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-2">18.6 Headings</h3>
            <p>Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation.</p>

            <p>We may publish program‑specific rules or guidelines (e.g., for particular affiliate programs or features). Those rules are incorporated by reference and apply in addition to these Terms. If there is a conflict, the program‑specific rules will control for that program.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">20. Survival</h2>
            <p>Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12–20 survive termination of these Terms and your use of the Services.</p>
