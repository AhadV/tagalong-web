                <li>To comply with our legal obligations and law enforcement requests.</li>

                <li>To track affiliate conversions and ensure proper attribution of bookings to the correct Creator.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">4. How do we collect your personal information?</h2>
            <p>(a) We will collect personal information directly from you wherever it is reasonable and practical to do so. We may collect personal information from you via:</p>
             <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                <li>your use and access of the Service, including during your registration as a Creator;</li>
                <li>website links, social media or through any other platform or channel where you make personal information available to us;</li>
                <li>your response to any surveys, travel questionnaires, or marketing materials we send out;</li>
                <li>travel experiences, recommendations, and itineraries uploaded to the Services by you or by other users;</li>
                <li>interactions between yourself, other users of the Services, and our support team;</li>
                <li>your travel booking activities through affiliate links on our platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(b) We may also collect your personal information from third parties including:</p>
             <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                <li>affiliate networks and travel booking platforms that partner with us and help us track conversions;</li>
                <li>third parties that provide us with marketing leads and travel industry data;</li>
                <li>third parties for whom we provide marketing and data analysis services;</li>
                <li>via public sources or when you connect with a social network service when using and accessing the Service;</li>
                <li>payment processors and financial institutions for commission disbursement purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you provide us with information about another person (e.g., travel companions or gift recipients), you will let that other person know that we use their personal information in the ways set out in this Privacy Policy, and that they can access the Privacy Policy on the Service or request a copy of it from us.</p>
            <p>(c) The legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the specific circumstances in which we collect that data. Generally, however, we will collect personal information from you where:</p>
             <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                <li>it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party (including in connection with the Service and commission payments);</li>
                <li>you have consented to our use of the personal information for one or more purposes;</li>
                <li>the processing is in the legitimate interests pursued by us, and those interests are balanced against your rights to privacy and do not override your interests or fundamental rights to the protection of your personal information; and</li>
                <li>to comply with a legal obligation and the law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">5. To whom may we disclose your personal information?</h2>
            <p>(a) <strong>Third party disclosure:</strong> We may disclose your personal information to various third parties. These third parties are likely to include:</p>
             <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                <li>affiliate networks and travel booking platforms in connection with tracking bookings and processing commissions;</li>
                <li>our lawyers, accountants and professional advisors;</li>
                <li>other third party service providers, such as payment processors for commission disbursements;</li>
                <li>to RoosterGoose, LLC and RGCOS related companies;</li>
                <li>to law enforcement authorities where we are required to do so by law or as a result of a legal process;</li>
                <li>in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, to any transferee of such business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to require that the transferee uses the personal information that you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy;</li>
                <li>third party payment processors for Creator commission payments;</li>
                <li>travel partners for the purpose of verifying bookings and resolving disputes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(b) In relation to 5(a)(7) above, because we process commission payments to Creators, we use third party services for payment processing. We will not store or collect your payment card details for bookings made through affiliate links—those are handled directly by the travel partners. For Creator commission payments, that information is provided directly to our third party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policies and their own terms and conditions. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by payment card industry data security standards ("PCI-DSS") as managed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>
            <p>(c) <strong>Important Notice Regarding Affiliate Commissions:</strong> TagAlong.me acts as an intermediary between Creators and travel affiliate partners. We distribute commissions to Creators within 30 days of receiving payment from our affiliate partners. However, TagAlong.me assumes no liability or responsibility if:</p>
             <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                <li>An affiliate partner fails to pay commissions owed;</li>
                <li>Tracking links fail or become invalid resulting in lost commissions;</li>
                <li>Bookings are cancelled or refunded resulting in commission reversals;</li>
                <li>Technical issues prevent proper tracking of affiliate conversions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In such cases, Creators must forfeit any expected profits related to those transactions. TagAlong.me will never cover losses arising from affiliate partner non-payment or tracking failures. Creators participate in the affiliate program at their own risk and should understand that commission payments are contingent upon successful receipt of funds from third-party affiliate partners.</p>
            
            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">6. How do we use cookies?</h2>
            <p>(a) To help improve the Service, certain information is collected from your browser. This information is collected as statistical information and may include the IP address, browser type, language and access times. Our websites also use cookies to track pages visited, travel searches performed, and information accessed. This information is for statistical reference, site analysis, conversion tracking, and to remember your details and preferences when you return to that website.</p>
            <p>(b) In many cases, the tools used on our website record information in a way that does not identify you as an individual. In other cases, information may be personal information in which case this Privacy Policy will apply.</p>
            <p>(c) Below we summarize why we use cookies and the different types that we use:</p>
             <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Necessary cookies:</strong> are those that are essential to run our website or to enable you to receive a service that you have requested. For example, to operate a Traveler's session, maintain Creator dashboards, or track affiliate conversions on the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance cookies:</strong> are those that collect information about how Travelers and Creators use and interact with our website, including which destinations are most popular, which experiences get the most clicks, and how users navigate through travel recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Functionality cookies:</strong> are those that remember the choices you make, such as your travel preferences, saved destinations, favorite Creators, language and country of choice. Without these cookies you may find that certain features are less convenient and reliable.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing cookies:</strong> are those that help us deliver travel deals and destination content that is more relevant to you and your interests. They include third party cookies placed by our partners and other advertisers who share cookie data with us. We use these cookies to re-target our travel recommendations to appropriate audiences within our advertising partners' platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Affiliate tracking cookies:</strong> are essential cookies that track when a Traveler clicks on an affiliate link and completes a booking. These cookies ensure proper attribution of bookings to the correct Creator for commission purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(d) The Service may also use third party website tools from time to time, for example data analytics, affiliate tracking systems, and online survey tools. These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are prohibited from disclosing or using it for any other purpose. These service providers may change from time to time.</p>
            <p>(e) Your web browser can also be configured to reject cookies. If you set up your web browser to reject cookies, certain functions of the Service may become unavailable to you, including the ability to track affiliate commissions and receive personalized travel recommendations.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">7. Direct marketing communications</h2>
            <p>From time to time we may send you direct marketing communications regarding travel deals, destination guides, new experiences, Creator recommendations, and our services. We may contact you by electronic messages (e.g. email), push notifications, online (e.g. through our Service), by mail and by other means, unless you opt-out or we are subject to legal restrictions from doing so. You may opt-out of receiving electronic messages from us at any time by contacting us via the contact details at the bottom of this Privacy Policy or by using the opt-out mechanism included in our marketing messages.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">8. How long do we retain your personal information?</h2>
            <p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and in each case in accordance with applicable law and regulation. For Creators, we will retain commission and booking data for at least seven years for tax and accounting purposes. For Travelers, we will retain booking history and preference data for as long as you maintain an active account with us.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">9. How do we secure your personal information?</h2>
            <p>(a) We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed.</p>
            <p>(b) In addition, we limit access to your personal information to employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need for access. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
            <p>(c) While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Therefore we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
            <p>(d) We implement encryption for all sensitive data transmission, including payment information for commission disbursements and personal account details. All affiliate tracking data is securely stored and regularly audited to prevent tampering or unauthorized modifications.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">10. Links to other sites</h2>
            <p>(a) From time to time, our Service (including this Privacy Policy) may contain links interfacing with other websites that are not operated by us for your information or convenience. This includes affiliate links to travel booking platforms, experience providers, accommodation services, and other travel-related websites.</p>
            <p>(b) These websites operate independently from our Service and may be subject to alternative terms of use, including terms concerning the use of personal information. We have not reviewed these third party websites and do not control and are not responsible for how they are operated, their content or privacy policies. When you click on an affiliate link and complete a booking on a third-party platform, your personal information and payment details are handled entirely by that platform according to their privacy policies.</p>
            <p>(c) If you decide to access or interact with any of these third party websites, including making bookings through our affiliate links, you do so at your own risk. As such, we strongly encourage you to review the privacy policy of every website you visit, especially when making travel bookings or providing payment information.</p>
            <p>(d) TagAlong.me is not responsible for any data breaches, privacy violations, or misuse of personal information that occurs on third-party affiliate partner websites. Our responsibility is limited to the handling of data within our own platform.</p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">11. What are your rights in relation to personal information?</h2>
            <p>(a) <strong>Access and correction of personal information:</strong> We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we handle is accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you become aware of any errors in your personal information or, if you change your personal information (including payment details for commission disbursements), please let us know.</p>
            <p>You can request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time. From time to time, we may need to reject your request to access personal information we hold about you, if we believe it to be necessary and to the extent allowed by law.

Depending on your request and where permitted by law, we may charge a small fee for complying with your request.</p>

            <p>(b) <strong>Other rights:</strong> Subject to certain limitations and restrictions (e.g. depending on circumstances such as where you reside) you may have the right to exercise additional rights in relation to your personal information. This may include rights under state privacy laws, the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") or the California Consumer Privacy Act.
